#The permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive is one of the best choices for a full range of motion control applications. For example, the PMSM is widely used in robotics, machine tools, actuators, and it is being considered in high-power applications such as industrial drives and vehicular propulsion. It is also used for residential/commercial applications. The PMSM is known for having low torque ripple, superior dynamic performance, high efficiency and high power density.


 The task is to design a model with appropriate feature engineering that estimates the target temperature of a rotor.


In this project, we will be using algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random forest and SVM. We will train and test the data with these algorithms and select the best model. Best algorithm will be selected and saved in pkl format. We will be doing flask integration
